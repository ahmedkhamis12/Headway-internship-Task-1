## How to submit the solutions for these exercises?
### Answer
1. Clone this repo to your environment.
2. For each exercise (ex. ```ex-1.md```), create a file with the coresponding number (ex. ```sol-1.txt``` or ```sol-1.sh```).
3. Add your solution to the file and save it, then create your own repo on Github and push your changes to that repo.

P.S.: Write the commands that solve the tasks in a text/bash file and make sure that it's reproducible.# headways-internship-exercises
