### Exercise 2: User and Group Management

1. Create a new user called devops_user and assign them to a group called devops.
2. Set a password for the user and ensure they are required to change it after the first login.
3. Add the user devops_user to the sudoers file, so they can run commands with superuser privileges.
4. Create another user called intern_user and add them to the devops group.
5. Verify that both users are in the devops group by checking the group membership.
