### Exercise 3: Managing Services and Automating Tasks

1. Install Nginx on your server and ensure the service is running.
2. Configure Nginx to start automatically on boot.
3. Edit unit file for Nginx to print the current machine time whenever the service started
4. Search for patterns in Nginx logs to extract lines that only contain http_status_code ```200 OK```. (hint: use *cat* - *grep* commands)
